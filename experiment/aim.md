### Aim of the experiment

In this experiment, the user is expected to learn about the process of maximum likelihood (ML) decoding of codes on various channels. The theory part explains the technical details. The experiments then enable the user to understand how likelihoods of the codewords in the code are to be calculated, and how the decoder declares that codeword which has the largest likelihood as the estimate. Further, the user also can understand that the ML decoder can make erroneous decisions, when the errors in the received vector are far too severe.
